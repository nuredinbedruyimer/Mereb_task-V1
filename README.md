# üöÄ **Mereb Technologies Challenge: Person Management API**

## üìö **Project Overview**
The **Person Management API** is designed for the **Mereb Technologies Challenge**. It provides a RESTful interface for managing person records through basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, incorporating essential data validation to ensure data integrity.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**
- **Go**: A statically typed, compiled programming language that is efficient and fast.
- **Gin**: A lightweight web framework for Go, known for its speed and minimal overhead.
- **In-Memory Database**: Utilizes an in-memory database for temporary storage of person records.

---

## ‚ú® **Key Features**
- **Create Person**: Add new person records to the database.
- **Get All Persons**: Retrieve a list of all person records.
- **Get Person**: Fetch a specific person record by ID.
- **Update Person**: Modify existing person records.
- **Delete Person**: Remove person records from the database.
- **Data Validation**: Validate incoming data to ensure it meets predefined criteria.

**Example JSON for Creating a Person**:

    {
    "id": "5d045199-4fcc-4713-8505-174305565f6a",
    "name": "Abeneze ADugna 1",
    "age": 81,
    "hobbies": [
        "Watching Movies",
        "Reading Books"
    ]
}
## üåê **Usage Instructions**
You can interact with the API using the following endpoints:

| HTTP Method | Endpoint                       | Description                          |
|-------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **POST**    | `http://localhost/persons`     | Create a new person record          |
| **GET**     | `http://localhost/persons`     | Retrieve a list of all persons      |
| **GET**     | `http://localhost/persons/:id` | Fetch a specific person by ID       |
| **PUT**     | `http://localhost/persons/:id` | Update an existing person record     |
| **DELETE**  | `http://localhost/persons/:id` | Delete a person record              |


 








## üí° **Conclusion**
The Person Management API serves as a robust solution for managing person records using Go and Gin. It emphasizes data validation and structured code organization, making it maintainable and extendable for future enhancements.
